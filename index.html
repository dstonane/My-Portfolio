    <P>When i was in college in Nebraska, i was majoring in Finance and minoring in Computer Programming but i did not really get the chance to complete my programming degree.</P>
    <p>I moved to New York couple years ago and with a friend we decided to found a Smart Shopping Carts startUp. That's what made me decide to enroll at Thinkul Bootcamp so i can feel more comfortable when talking about technical parts of the project. </p>

      <li>Playing soccer,</li>
